# FAL Cleanup

This is a TYPO3 CMS extension that provides a CLI command for removing all unused files from the *fileadmin* and *uploads* directory using the reference table `sys_file_reference` of FAL.

## Installation

Add it into the `typo3conf/ext` folder.

via git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trenker/typo3.fal_clean.git typo3conf/ext/fal_clean
```

or via composer
```bash
composer require georggrossberger/fal-clean
```

Using the composer method will, of course, require an installation using the [composer integration](http://composer.typo3.org) of TYPO3.

In both cases, go to the extension manager module and install it.

There is currently no TER release.

## Usage

The extension offers two CLI extbase commands: `simulate` and `execute`. The first will list which records and files will be deleted. The second one acutally deletes them.

```bash
# Show unused files and records
php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase falclean:simulate

# Remove the files
php typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase falclean:simulate
```

Make sure your FAL relations are properly set up, or it will delete more than desired.
